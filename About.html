<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I grew up in rural south africa, in a family of 6, I wouldnt say we were struggling as my father had done pretty well for himself, enough to allow me to get the best education inour area from primary to seconday school.
    <br>
    With a father who is a pastoor I was raised into Christianity which is where I base my roots and ffoundation on eveything i do, God is in the center of it all.
    <br>
    I used to be such a quite kid, spending a lot of time indoors watching alot of movies, and thats were it started, I was watching a movie called spy kids and I could not help but admire the guys who made all the gadgets and knew how they worked. I actually started to go through the old equipment at home, trying to be those guys, breaking them apart seeing what is inside, but it didnt make any sense at the time. But that drove me to want to understand it more.
    <br>
    I actually started following on the technology competitions at school, trying to get the different magazines we had at the time to see what it all meant and read up anything tech that I could find.
    <br>
    That pushed me to look for the best possible degree that i could that would make me that. At first I went for computer engineering, with electronics as my second option, but as I go to university, I opted for Electronics, purely because it involved alot of the actual electronics.
    <br>
    During the studies, that is when i discovered the love and passion in programming, I wouldnt say it was love at first sight, as it didnt make any sense initially, I actually failed the first time of asking, but the passion started, as I actually looked to understand more what it all was about. The second time I actually passed it with a distinction, and I from there was hooked into software development.
    <br>
    I started work as ana electronics technician where we did PCB's and also embedded programming, but at the time i wanted to learn more about software development and I then took on bachelos of Science in Apllied Mathematics and Computer Science. And thus my journey was on course.
    <br>
    I was fortunate enought to find a job where it started as an internship as an Embedded software engineer and because of God's Grace and Favour and the capabilitites I was showing and the trust that the management team had, I quickly rose throught the ranks to go from Intern to CTO in a very short space of time.
    <br>
    My Journey is one of continuous learning, continuous adaptation and growth.
    <br>
    I aspire to bring greatness wherever I am, and to achieve heights greater than ever expected.
